You MUST implement ONLY Stage {stage} of the plan. Nothing else.

Here is the section of the plan you must implement:

{stage_section}

RULES:
1. Implement EXACTLY what Stage {stage} describes. Do NOT implement other stages.
2. Every file MUST use FULL relative paths from project root (e.g. `src/game/collision.ts`, NOT `collision.ts`).
3. Match the project structure from Architecture. If "Current project files" are provided, follow the same structure.
4. NEVER place source files in the project root — only config files like `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts` go in root.
5. Output ONLY files you create or modify in this stage.
6. Do NOT duplicate code that already exists — import from existing modules.
7. Do NOT leave stubs, placeholders, or TODOs.
8. If unsure about a decision, list alternatives in AI_NOTES — do NOT make hidden assumptions.
9. Follow coding standards from constitution.
10. Check compliance with architectural invariants.
11. If your code adds new third-party dependencies (imports/requires), you MUST also output the updated dependency config file (`pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, etc.) with the new packages added. Check the existing config files provided in context for the correct format.

OUTPUT FORMAT — each file wrapped in file markers with the FULL path:

--- FILE: src/game/module.ts ---
// file content here
--- END FILE ---

--- FILE: tests/module.test.ts ---
// test content here
--- END FILE ---

⚠️ You MUST use the --- FILE: / --- END FILE --- markers shown above.
Do NOT wrap code in ```python, ```javascript or any other markdown code fences — those will NOT be parsed.

LAST file must be AI_NOTES:

--- FILE: AI_NOTES.md ---
# AI_NOTES — Stage {stage}: <title from plan>

## What was done
- <list of changes>

## Why this approach
- <rationale>

## Files created / modified
| File | Action | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `src/game/module.ts` | created | what and why |

## Risks and limitations
- <known issues>

## Invariant compliance
- [ ] <invariant> — respected / violated (explain)

## How to verify
1. <command or manual check>
